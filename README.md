How to Play
The objective of Tetris is to clear lines by moving and rotating falling tetrominoes (geometric shapes made of four square blocks). As you clear lines, you earn points.

Here are the basic rules:

Use the arrow keys to move the falling tetromino left, right, or down.
Press the "Up" arrow key to rotate the tetromino.
Try to complete horizontal lines with no gaps to clear them.
When you clear lines, you score points.
The game ends when the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the screen.
Controls
Use the left arrow key to move the tetromino left.
Use the right arrow key to move the tetromino right.
Use the down arrow key to move the tetromino down faster.
Use the up arrow key to rotate the tetromino.
